What wins or better understanding did you have at the end of this lab?

I feel much more confident with flexbox and its basic properties. It took me a while to really understand the main axis and cross axis, along with which properties (justify vs align) will adjust items along those axes. The property I feel most confident with as a result of this lab is the Order property. I also feel very confident with my selectors, and figured out how to nest my selectors in css to keep my code looking relatively clean. A goal of mine in this lab was to only have a single parent selector per tetrimino piece, though I had several nested selectors for a few pieces. 

Which concepts do you still feel you need to work on?

I didn't get to use a few properties of flexbox, namely flex-basis, flex-grow and flex-shrink, although i believe these are more useful for responsive web design, which I know we'll get to soon. I still need practice distinguishing between properties which affect the flex container and the flex items. 

Altogether, i'm feeling very good about my code, and I am confident I can explain what each line of code does and why I wrote it that way.
